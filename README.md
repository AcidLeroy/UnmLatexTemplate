# Unofficial UNM LaTeX Template for a Thesis

This is the unofficial place to get the University of New Mexico LaTeX document for a Master's thesis. I can't take credit for this, I just copied (stole) from 
[UNM Math Heads](http://www.math.unm.edu/~gthesis/latex/). It makes more sense to have this thing version controlled, so if someone finds
that my version is out of date **PLEASE SEND A PULL REQUEST**! Together, let's make the world a better place :+1: :neckbeard:
